# Overview

This is my project, what I did is a program that save data in a file and display that data in a table. 

My program run on Java and have 3 files in a package. The first file is the user file for the creation or intantiation of an object from the User class. This class has 3 properties (name, age, and talk).
I added another file called Method class, and I wrote all the methods to will work with the User class. 
I also added another feature to this program and is the use of a GUI, for a nice presentation of the program. 
The program also create a text file when it runs the file is "children.txt" where you can see all the children that has been added to the table.
